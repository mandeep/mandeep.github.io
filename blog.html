            <div class="blog_post_content"><p>In February 2024, I released an obstacle course game (obby) called Chill But Not Too Chill Obby on the Roblox platform. For new Roblox developers, creating an obby as a first game seems to be a rite of passage. My journey was no different.

                What I thought would take only a week or two turned into a whole month-long adventure, with weekly updates along the way. My original draft was just a basic obby with routine obstacles. However, as I started working on the levels, I felt the urge to design unique and challenging obstacles. I wanted to create something I could be proud of, not just another run-of-the-mill game that looked like a template.
                
                Before diving into the game, I played more popular obbies on Roblox than I care to admit, trying to figure out what hooked players. I noticed a few things that these games had in common: an open-air environment, easy transitions from one level to the next, and simple object models. I decided to incorporate and expand on these elements in my game to give players a sense of familiarity.
